# Title
Hellow world!
This is a repository made for learning how git works.
Everything here is done following [this course on udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/git-and-github-crash-course-creating-a-repository-from-scratch)


### Terminology
- cloning: a fancy way to say copying the remote repo to your local machine
- staging: preparing a file/directory for sending it to the repository.
- commit: Sending a staged files.
- push: send committed changes to the remote repo.


### So far I learned
- Making this repo using github website, no CLI yet.
- Cloned my repo to my Linux machine.

Cheers!!
