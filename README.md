# Title
Hellow world!
This is a repository made for learning how git works.
Everything here is done following [this course on udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/git-and-github-crash-course-creating-a-repository-from-scratch)

*So far I learned:*
- Making this repo using github website, no CLI yet.
- Cloned my repo to my Linux machine.
- 

Cheers!!
